            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>No compilation
                        <small>You don’t have to compile code you can just run it.(In case of static language you can&nbsp;reduce
                            compile time with `incremental compilation`)
                        </small>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Can pretend static
                        <small>There are some&nbsp;techniques like `JsDoc` that can increase static&nbsp;analysis
                            purpose and IDE support.&nbsp;
                        </small>

                        <small>You can do whatever you want. And write code faster.</small>

            <h3>Main features of static typing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>You cannot change variable type
                        <small>once you declare `string` it will be `string` till the end. Assigning value of another
                            type will lead to Exception.
                        </small>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Functions have contracts
                        <small>(strictly defined input parameters and output types) which gives us better understanding
                            about what function does. Also it gives us so called `parameter overloading` which may be
                            useful sometimes. Python offers overloading mechanism too because of it strict typing.
                        </small>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>May also offer `type inference`
                        <small>mechanism of determining variable type in compile time by type of&nbsp;initially assigned
                            value. Which may reduce a bit code producing time and remove unnecessary boilerplate.

            <p>But what can cause faster development in case of statically typed language?</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Fewer bugs in produced code
                        <small>You know about wrong assignments, function calls,&nbsp;returns immediately after
                            compilation or static&nbsp;analysis. Static analysis can be also applicable to&nbsp;dynamically
                            typed languages but have no such&nbsp;great effect.&nbsp;
                        </small>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You&nbsp;don’t need to know the scope
                        <small>Functions always have strictly declared inputs and output. You don’t have to trace
                            function calls to understand what parameters you got and what you have to do.
                        </small>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Writing unit test for static typing takes less time
                        <small>Here we just have to create more test in case of `secure` code. Again with static typing&nbsp;compiler
                            will do the job.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Writing secure code is almost&nbsp;impossible or cost a lot of lines
                        <small>
                            If you creating component that have to be secure (sometimes you have to in case of library
                            or business requirements) you have to handle all possible input types and time of producing
                            will dramatically increase.
                            With static typing you code is secure by default (don’t miss with secure business logic).

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <small>Some languages have a greater association with defects (bugs) than other languages, although
                        the effect is small. (Closure, Scala are winning one)
                    </small>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <small>There is a small but significant relationship between language class and defects. Functional
                        languages are associated with fewer defects than either procedural or scripting languages.
                        (Functional-Static-Strict is the best)
                    </small>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <small>There is no general relationship between application domain and language defect proneness.
                    </small>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <small>Defect types are strongly associated with languages; some defect type like memory errors and
                        concurrency errors also depend on language primitives. Language matters more for specific
                        categories than it does for defects overall.
